# Master-Thesis-Alina-Zaidan
This repository contains code used for the Master Thesis of Alina Zaidan. It is a part of the Osnabrück Plaza Project, which is developed by Aitana Grasso-Cladera, MSc. and Debora Nolte, MSc. (Neurobiopsychology Laboratory at the Institute of Cognitive Sciences; Osnabrück University) and is supervised by Prof. Dr. Peter König and Prof. Dr. Tim Kietzmann.

"Yolo.ipynb" and "categoried_fixations.ipynb" contain the code used for detection and mapping of body AOIs and combining with face fixation detected by Pupil Labs (RetinaFace).

"face_landmarks_voronoi.ipynb" and "Voronoi_illustration.ipynb" contain the code used for the methods subsections 2.3.1 'Facial Landmark Detection and AOI Definition", 2.3.3  "Frontal and Lateral Face Categorization" and results section 3.2 "Attention on Facial Landmarks in the Real World".

"spatial_resolution_FL.ipynb" contains the code used for the subsection 2.3.2 "Eye-Tracker Spatial Resolution for Facial Landmark Analysis" and 3.2 "Attention on Facial Landmarks in the Real World" to estimate of the minimum pixel size necessary for reliable detection by the eye-tracking device.

"fixation_analysis.ipynb" and "Transition probabilities.ipynb" contain the code used for the results of section 3.1 "Social Attention in the Real-World versus VR
Environments" for the real-world data.

"VR data fixation analysis.ipynb" contains the code used for the results of sections 3.1.2 "Fixation Proportions Across Object Types", 3.1.3 "Fixation Durations of Different Types" and 3.1.4 "Transition Probabilities Across Fixation Types" for the VR data from [Combining EEG and Eye-Tracking in Virtual Reality - Obtaining Fixation-Onset ERPs and ERSPs](https://osf.io/trfjw/).

"PCA&correlations&clustering.ipynb" contains the code used for results of sections 3.3 "Correlational and Principal Component Analysis" and 3.4 "Clustering".
